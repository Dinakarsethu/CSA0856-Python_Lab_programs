#Day-5 program-3 Given an integer n, return the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to n. A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself. For example, 1, 4, 9, and 16 are perfect squares while 3 and 11 are not.

import math

def num_squares(n):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, int(math.sqrt(i)) + 1):
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - j*j] + 1)
    return dp[n]
